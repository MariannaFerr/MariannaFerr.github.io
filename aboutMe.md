	<img border="0" src="{% link assets/images/fancyCropped.jpg %}" align="left"> Hey there, I'm Marianna! Currently, I'm a first-year Computer Science major at the University of Calgary with a deep interest in involving myself in the field. My goal is to be more than just a coder; someone who can be relied on in a team to contribute meaningful solutions to daunting problems. Iâ€™m a methodical maniac by nature, and I believe one must constantly keep learning in order to be able to solve complications effectively. Recently, my curiosity has been piqued by the field of Information Security. The last 2 years I've spent as a member of the InfoSec Club at the University of Calgary has been monumental in my search for knowledge within the fields I am interested in, and I hope I can continue to grow and satiate my desire to learn.

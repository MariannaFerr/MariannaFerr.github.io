					<h3>Foodie</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I'm a gourmand at heart who loves to try all kinds of cuisines. Despite this fact, you might be surprised to learn that I grew up as a picky eater. A good meal can change my whole day, and I believe you should always treat yourself kindly and eat well. I am espeically fond of Italian dishes!</p>

					<h3>Drawing</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Iâ€™ve been drawing as early as I can remember. My hobby took off when I started drawing frequently in math class back in junior high, which began as small character doodles. There is lots of sketching, construction lines, and placeholder shapes that must be laid down before the drawing becomes more intermediate. Breaking down an idea has helped me navigate through rather large-scale projects and given me a deeper understanding of how to enhance my artwork. This ability translates well to how I attack problems, whether that be disputes in my friend groups or particularly tricky math computations. It may be a very time-consuming hobby, with some projects taking me over 12 hours, but I feel such immense pleasure from bringing an idea to life with my own hands. My favourite things to draw are people; I love coming up with complicated poses and telling small stories with my art.</p>

					<h3>Travelling</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Though I'm not a huge fan of physically travelling from point A to point B, I love to explore new cities. My latest and greatest adventure was a trip to Portugal with my famiy, where we enjoyed breathtaking hikes, fresh fish, and black sand beaches.
